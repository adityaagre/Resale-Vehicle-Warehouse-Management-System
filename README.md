 Resale Vehicle Warehouse Management System 
 
 Abstract
The Vehicle Warehouse Management System is a software solution aimed at automating and streamlining the warehouse management processes for second-hand vehicle resellers. With the growing prominence of the vehicle resale industry, there is a need for efficient management of warehouses to handle tasks such as sorting, storage, servicing, maintenance, quality assessment, and transport of vehicles. The existing operations of many vehicle resellers are disorganized, leading to challenges in managing inventory, tracking vehicles, assigning tasks to workers, and maintaining accurate records.
To address these challenges, our software system aims to automate the logistics processes involved in vehicle warehousing. By leveraging technology, we seek to reduce human effort, enhance efficiency, minimize errors, and provide a smoother workflow for warehouse administrators and workers. The system will offer functionalities such as inventory management, vehicle tracking, maintenance scheduling, quality assessment, and data management for vehicles stored in warehouses.
